       <br> <h3>My Career Goals</h3>
        <p>As a lover of art, strategy, and efficiency, 
            my biggest dream is to work in a position 
            where all of these elements can be combined. 
            I specifically love video games and television
             and would love to be a marketing manager in either
              industry one day. My intrinsic motivations are to 
              work on a team with passionate co-workers who deeply
               care about what they do, and share their work to inspire others. </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>My Community</h3>
        <p>I currently spend lots of time with friends who aspire
             to be video game developers. Many of these friends participate 
              actively in events at my college and are active members of the Game 
              Development Club at school. I participate on the board as the marketing 
              advisor/marketing strategist. We recently participated in the indie festival 
              held by my university. Below is a photo of a team of game developers I
               work with on a project named Snyatcher. We were there to showcase a game 
               currently in the works that I plan to market for once it is complete. </p>
